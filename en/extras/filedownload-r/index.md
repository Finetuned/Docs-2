## What is FileDownloadR?

This MODX Extra can be used to display a list of files from a directory. The download link for each file is hashed. This way, the full url of the file will not be revealed and the files/directories can be located outside the webroot. Each file can also be assigned a download counter, which is stored in a custom database table.

## History & Info

The FileDownloadR project was started in 2011 by [Rico Goldsky](https://github.com/goldsky) as a rewite of the FileDownload Evolution package by Kyle Jaebker. It is maintained since 2023 by [Thomas Jakobi](https://github.com/jako).
